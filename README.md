# Assignment-04-Javascript-Assignment
In this assignment you are required to review any of the the options we talked about in class including but not limited to creating a firefox or chrome extension, doing some data visualizations using some online JavaScript tool, doing some mapping of data, contributing to an open-source project on GitHub, creating a mobile phone app using JavaScript, using one of the standard JavaScript APIs to do something interesting, etc. For any project you choose, whats important is sort of the way you put things together, not really the language dynamics - and thats why we are using JavaScript
